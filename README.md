## The app for book lovers everywhere!
I created this app with the intention that I'd use it to keep track of all the books I plan on reading. 

As an avid reader, I have an extensive list of books I plan to read one day. Keeping track of all these books is impossibly hard and only writing down the title of each book doesn't allow me to remember what the book is about or why I wanted to read it in the first place. This app solves that problem as it helps me keep track of all the books I want to read in the future and what they're about.

## What does this app do?
* This app helps users find and save the books they love.
* Users can then save the books they wish to read later and delete them once they're done.

# What technologies does this app employ?
* Full MERN stack app (MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js).
* Google Books API.
* Bootstrap for basic styling.
