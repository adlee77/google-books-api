# Link to my app - [Google Books App](https://googlebooks-api-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Next Update
Adding Auth0 authentication for users to save books to their profile.

## The app for book lovers everywhere!
I created this app with the intention that I'd use it to keep track of all the books I plan on reading. 

As an avid reader, I have an extensive list of books I plan to read one day. Keeping track of all these books is impossibly hard and only writing down the title of each book doesn't allow me to remember what the book is about or why I wanted to read it in the first place. This app solves that problem as it helps me keep track of all the books I want to read in the future and what they're about.

## What does this app do?
* This app helps users find and save the books they love.
* Users can then save the books they wish to read later and delete them once they're done.

# What technologies does this app employ?
* Full MERN stack app (MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js).
* Google Books API.
* Bootstrap for basic styling.

## Below are the basic React instructions to run this app locally.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
